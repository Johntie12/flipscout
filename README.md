# FlipScout Website (scaffold)

This is a minimal Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold for a FlipScout website.

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

2. Run locally
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

Notes:
- Designed to be connected to the existing backend API (set base URL via environment variables).
- I can add auth (NextAuth/Clerk), CI workflows, and simple pages (pricing, docs, sign-in) next.
